## Image Slider with Auto-Play and Manual Navigation Buttons

In this project, I designed an Image Slider (slideshow/carousel) with both auto-play and manual navigation, using CSS, HTML, and JavaScript. 

You can navigate manually to any slide using buttons.

Autoplay navigation automatically changes slides due to a timer set by using JavaScript.
